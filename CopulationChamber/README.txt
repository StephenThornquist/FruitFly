Annotation of copulation chamber rework for optogenetics:

Original design on bottom of schematic

"Top layer" corresponds to transparent sheet which keeps the rotating "lids" in place

"Etch layer" contains the etching of the Crickmore lab name and the carved out "lids" that allow the deposit of flies

"Hole layer" is cut out of a thick sheet of dark acrylic and houses the behaving fly

"Bottom layer" is carved out to allow the insertion of the collimated LED light
