- Sent Dragana fly stocks for Chrimson (BSC 55134-9)
- Practiced dissection of ventral nerve cord in adult males
- LED and optics under consideration:
	Luxeon Rebel LED
	LEDEngin LEDs (Expensive!!)
	Polymer Optics Collimators 
	Carclo Lenses
	Khatod Circular Beam Optic

- Ordered 26 Carclo frosted square optics and 26 Luxeon Rebels

06/23/2014

- Practiced dissection of mating flies

06/24/2014

- Flies are really reluctant to do any mating
- Returned Carclo frosted square optics in favor of Carclo 20 mm narrow beams
- Purchased: 5 700 mA non-adjustable BuckPucks, 12"x12" aluminum sheet
- Made a pretty fruit fly

06/25/2014

- Ordered deep red Luxeon LEDs premounted on Endor Star 1-UP mounts
- Practiced abdominal ganglion dissection

06/26/2014

- Mounted Luxeon LEDs arrived with Carclo lens holders (no lenses or sink yet)
- Adjusted LightChamber.svg (.svg file with schematic of optogenetics chamber)
  to accomodate the Carclo lenses
- Practiced abdominal ganglion prep

06/27/2014

- Lenses and aluminum arrived from LEDSupply. BuckPucks were not dimmable
  so I took 4 750 mA dimmable BuckPucks from Ofer and Pavel.

- Cut aluminum heat sink from aluminum sheet, glued mounted lenses to mounted
  LEDs using Loctite instant adhesive, affixed LEDs/lenses to aluminum heat
  sink using thermal epoxy after wiring LEDs together.

- LEDs are connected 6 in series to a BuckPuck

- Practiced abdominal ganglion dissection

06/28/2014

- Fly food for UAS-ReaChR stock was wet and I didn't notice any eggs or larva
  so I transfered most of the surviving flies to a new food vial

- Crossed UAS-mCherry-ReaChR (II) to TH-C'-GAL4, DDC-GAL4, and TH-GAL4 lines

- Wrote code to operate LED array (titled FlashingLights contained in this
  github repository)

07/01/2014

- Soldered together Buckpuck inputs for LED array (should be completely ready)

- Practiced abd. gang. prep

07/02/2014

- Attempted imaging NP5270 > UAS-GCaMP3.0 - UAS-tdTomato in abd. gangl. of an isolated male glued to a slide. Green visible but
  no obvious dynamics. Will reattempt

- Two Elav-C155; UAS-Dicer2/Cy0 x UAS-ReaChR offspring placed in optogenetics chamber. No obvious response from very superficial examination. 
  Notes: Need to change sheet under the doors so that flies can't crawl between chambers. Chambers are maybe too tall (allow flies  climb on walls). Should try again when I receive the higher power supply. Also consider refitting chamber with higher power LED   arrays (e.g. 3UP deep reds from Luxeon). Also keep in mind that ReaChR is less red-shifted than Chrimson and I bought LEDs        spec'd for Chrimson. When I have more than two flies I'll try this experiment again (hopefully tomorrow?? possibly later today)

- Wilson lab has Chrimson flies; maybe I'll try those?

- Reattempted abdominal ganglion imaging in isolated male fly. Expression pattern appeared to be normal. Will re-do with more spec  ific GAL4 driver tomorrow.
