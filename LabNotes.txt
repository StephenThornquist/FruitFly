- Sent Dragana fly stocks for Chrimson (BSC 55134-9)
- Practiced dissection of ventral nerve cord in adult males
- LED and optics under consideration:
	Luxeon Rebel LED
	LEDEngin LEDs (Expensive!!)
	Polymer Optics Collimators 
	Carclo Lenses
	Khatod Circular Beam Optic

- Ordered 26 Carclo frosted square optics and 26 Luxeon Rebels

06/23/2014

- Practiced dissection of mating flies

06/24/2014

- Flies are really reluctant to do any mating
- Returned Carclo frosted square optics in favor of Carclo 20 mm narrow beams
- Purchased: 5 700 mA non-adjustable BuckPucks, 12"x12" aluminum sheet
- Made a pretty fruit fly

06/25/2014

- Ordered deep red Luxeon LEDs premounted on Endor Star 1-UP mounts
- Practiced abdominal ganglion dissection

06/26/2014

- Mounted Luxeon LEDs arrived with Carclo lens holders (no lenses or sink yet)
- Adjusted LightChamber.svg (.svg file with schematic of optogenetics chamber)
  to accomodate the Carclo lenses
- Practiced abdominal ganglion prep

06/27/2014

- Lenses and aluminum arrived from LEDSupply. BuckPucks were not dimmable
  so I took 4 750 mA dimmable BuckPucks from Ofer and Pavel.

- Cut aluminum heat sink from aluminum sheet, glued mounted lenses to mounted
  LEDs using Loctite instant adhesive, affixed LEDs/lenses to aluminum heat
  sink using thermal epoxy after wiring LEDs together.

- LEDs are connected 6 in series to a BuckPuck

- Practiced abdominal ganglion dissection

06/28/2014

- Fly food for UAS-ReaChR stock was wet and I didn't notice any eggs or larva
  so I transfered most of the surviving flies to a new food vial

- Crossed UAS-mCherry-ReaChR (II) to TH-C'-GAL4, DDC-GAL4, and TH-GAL4 lines

- Wrote code to operate LED array (titled FlashingLights contained in this
  github repository)

07/01/2014

- Soldered together Buckpuck inputs for LED array (should be completely ready)

- Practiced abd. gang. prep

07/02/2014

- Attempted imaging NP5270 > UAS-GCaMP3.0 - UAS-tdTomato in abd. gangl. of an isolated male glued to a slide. Green visible but
  no obvious dynamics. Will reattempt

- Two Elav-C155; UAS-Dicer2/Cy0 x UAS-ReaChR offspring placed in optogenetics chamber. No obvious response from very superficial examination. 
  Notes: Need to change sheet under the doors so that flies can't crawl between chambers. Chambers are maybe too tall (allow flies  climb on walls). Should try again when I receive the higher power supply. Also consider refitting chamber with higher power LED   arrays (e.g. 3UP deep reds from Luxeon). Also keep in mind that ReaChR is less red-shifted than Chrimson and I bought LEDs        spec'd for Chrimson. When I have more than two flies I'll try this experiment again (hopefully tomorrow?? possibly later today)

- Wilson lab has Chrimson flies; maybe I'll try those?

- Reattempted abdominal ganglion imaging in isolated male fly. Expression pattern appeared to be normal. Will re-do with more spec  ific GAL4 driver tomorrow.

07/03/2014

- Reimaged NP5270 > UAS-GCaMP 3.0 male during mating (attempted). Dismounted during prep. Unable to see much fluoresence??? Bizarre

- UAS-ReaChR flies also unsuccessful again. Hard to say, though, since flies could use the aforementioned design flaw to escape the box entirely (and seemed very interested in doing so).

07/04/2014

- Power cable for LED array set up (3 A, >18V are minimum requirements)

- Dissection of NP5270 > UAS-GCaMP 3.0 isolated male. Fluoresence looked fine.

07/08/2014

- Relative dearth of fluorescent male flies lately for abd. gang. prep

- Inspected mCherry fluoresence in ddc-GAL4>UAS-ReaChR-mCherry stocks; some fluorescent cells but not as many as I expect. I'll check the other GAL4-driven ReaChR stocks too

- Chrimson-mVenus lines arrived (UAS and LexAop2)

07/13/2014

- Realized a few days ago that I forgot to feed the ReaChR flies retinal

- ReaChR offspring put on all-trans-retinal on the 11th. Will attempt experiment again on the 14th

- Crossed Chrimson lines to various dopaminergic GAL4 lines (TH-D', TH-C', ddc, TH)

- Elav-Chrimson cross on the 11th

07/14/2014

- No fluoresence visible now in the NP2719 > GCamP3.0 - mCherry males??

- ddc>ReaChR flies tested again under red LEDs. Possible response? Needs to be quantitatively analyzed

- Possible hurdles:
	Hard to see flies on LEDs in video (change camera settings?? do post-processing?)
	Not clear if expression is good (will do brain dissection on flies shortly)

- Crossed NP5270 to TH-GAL4. Intend to drive TrpA1 in both sets of neurons simultaneously to see whether they "compete" or if they're organized hierarchically (in DECAPITATED flies; in Crickmore/Vosshall they did this in normal flies and saw that the GABAergic line wins out but the cop. dur. seems to more closely resemble WT than either individually).	

07/15/2014

- Set up crosses of both GABAergic lines to all 3 types of GCaMP6 (F,M,S)

- Try to do simultaneous TrpA1 / Chrimson? Maybe Chrimson + ReaChR (use separable LED spectra)?

- Maybe we can try QuaSaR too??

07/21/2014

- Thorlabs shortpass 550 nm? filter affixed to front of camera, blocks all LED light so we can see the flies moving around

07/22/2014

- TH>Chrimson 20 Hz 30 ms pulse width successfully drives retinal-fed flies into seizures but does not appear to affect non-retinal-fed flies. Video file MVI_0057.MP4 on 07/22/2014

07/23/2014

- ddc>Chrimson 20 Hz 30 ms run (fill in results when done)

08/14/2014

- Finally back from Alaska

- NP5270 > UAS-GCaMP6M produces visible green fluoresence in abd. gang. in dissected non-mating male. Green washes out after a while. Unsuccessful dissections so far trying to get mating males I can image

- Peltier units arrived; will begin prototype heating exp. environment shortly.

08/19/2014

- I've been pretty bad about keeping a good lab notebook. Hopefully I can change that here.

- Remember to keep track of Chrimson + double balancer crosses! Goal: produce Chrimson/Cy0 stock and Chrimson/Sb stock.

- ddc and TH > Chrimson experiments stored in the last several days. 10 Hz 10 ms pulses and 5 Hz 5 ms pulses both seem sufficient to induce behavior without causing seizing. Need to do controls for paralysis!! Behaviors which could be induced during red light to demonstrate lack of paralysis include courtship or a fear response to an aversive stimulus (e.g. heat from Peltier units or a visual loom stimulus).

- ddc > Chrimson induces rapid place preference, apparently. But the memory is not retained when the red light is shut off, so maybe place preference isn't the right word; rather, it's just a sense of enjoying the sensation (10 hz 10 ms)

- TH>Chrimson causes an apparent aversive reaction at both 10 hz 10 ms and 5 hz 5 ms. Flies scuttle about frantically whenever they enter the red light until they manage to exit it (and sometimes continue panicking for a bit). They learn fairly quickly not to stand where the light is.

- Do the flies have a sense of where they are in space? Are there even sufficient visual cues to guide them?

- Apparent green fluoresence in a FEW abd. gang. cells driving GCaMP6M with NP5270 repoGal80 (the driver with more broad expression across the whole VNC)

- Need to work on Peltier device!!

-w;TH-C'/+;UAS-Chrimson-mVenus/+ experiment with 10 Hz 10 ms stimulation, alternating at 10 min (accidentally set the right half to 19 Hz, 10 ms! Let's see how that turns out)
-Above expt: 19 Hz, 10 ms causes seizures (no surprise). 10 hz 10 ms is still evidently quite negative.

-TH-C' > Chrimson expt. with SAME FLIES at 5 Hz, 5 ms. Light stimulus again alternates. The flies go bonkers!

-Same genotype as above, 10 Hz 5 ms (NOTE: accidental bug in code I just wrote meant that the startup of the light flashing went a little weird, so I paused the video to fix it. Thus there's a jump at ~10:10 in the video)

08/26/2014

-ddc>Chrimson NO RETINAL 10 hz 5 ms alternating at 10 min. First expt. done by manually turning on lights. Second round done with new Arduino script which turns on lights on its own (so I don't startle the flies)

-Wireless streaming of flies in a box using Raspberry Pi
-Set up Raspberry Pi <--> Arduino USB communication using Nanpy. (NOTE: Arduino code for RasPis should be written in Python using Nanpy; importing other code onto the Arduino will remove the firmware and its ability to communicate with the RasPi via USB)

-Thermistor + heat complex works but the current through the Peltiers (700 mA) is insufficient to dramatically heat the chamber. Will need higher current loads with better parts
-Imaging facility response (FINALLY), will need to wait for Tony Hill to come back from vacation (October 7th)
-New box: Pavel ran out of black acrylic, will order more from McMaster-Carr
-Analysis pipeline: Can do streaming for Raspi videos but have not done motion tracking (yet).
-Lots of GAL4 > Chrimson lines are ready to go; just need the camera set-up to be available too. Should prioritize that until the new parts come in

09/26/2014

- TH > Chrimson experiment performed (file name is THTrialRun.h264), 5 Hz 5 ms stimulus (purportedly; needs to be tested better)
- Upon revision, it apparently takes approximately 200 ms for the Python script to cycle through all the lights (REALLY?) That explains the seizing. So I guess I should rewrite everything to be a bit more pythonic
TODO:
As above

10/01/2014

- TH>Chrimson experiment (5 Hz 5 ms stim with 5 minute switch time) saved as THChrimsonOct1.h264

10/02/2014

- ddc>Chrimson 5 hz 5 ms nice phenotype! Not analyzed but looks good, could use for Mike (saved as ddcChrimson5Hz5ms.h264)

11/09/2014

- So much for being a lot more diligent about this thing.

- 10 Hz 1 ms stimulation of NP5270>Chrimson males copulating with Elav females terminates copulation early (n=4). Will repeat experiment multiple times today, try different stimuli (also toying with lighting)
- 5 Hz 1 ms does the same.
Data in NP5270ChrimsonCopulation spreadsheet
-EscapeNewLights.h264 contains responses of GCI stimulation starting with 25 Hz then off, then 1 Hz, 5 Hz, 10 Hz, 25 Hz stimuli. (pw 5 ms)

11/11/2014

-10 Hz 1 ms stimulus causes seizure in TH>Chrimson as before, dialed down to 10 Hz 300 us stimulus for expts. Slightly erratic male behavior but not so bad. No apparent effect on copulation duration!!

-20 Hz 5 ms seemed to tweak them out too much, switched to 1 ms after a few minutes. We'll see... Male courts a dead female with this stimulus though.
No such luck. Huh. Will dissect TH>Chrimson flies to check expression.
- Dissection looked good! Even more puzzling... will try again with lower settings after flies have had some time to recover

-10Hz1ms Chrimson/+ flies copulate normally (see video). 
Side note: Second mating in the same ~1 hour seems to be shorter in duration than the first

-10Hz1ms NP5270>Chrimson flies has mild effect on copulation duration, but hard to say for sure.

-10Hz 1ms NP5270>Chrimson (NO RETINAL) flies: No effect

11/12/2014

- 10Hz 1ms NP5270>Chrimson flies NO retinal: Still no effect

11/21/2014

- Trying TH>Chrimson again. Flies seem a little jumpy and weird even without light stimulation. Constant light stim makes flies much jumpier but does not seem to have experiment-ruining effects yet. Will update with cop. durs. Does dramatically prolong copulation. Will have to try with less intense stim.

- NP5270>Chrimson constant light stim: shortens copulation in 3 out of 4 flies

11/25/2014

- Trying NP5270>Chrimson. video out of focus for some unknown reason? Will adjust after expt. is finished. Stimulus: Constant red light. Flies are a little jumpier but doesn't seem to be devastating yet. Two copulating pairs, one 8 minutes and one 16 minutes. Maybe some adaptation to red light in Chrimson? Will try again with 20 Hz stim after lunch.

- 20 Hz 1 ms: activated on flies which were previously copulating, male fly starts trying to break up. Not sure how long into copulation they were though.

Changing the setup a little at 1:45: I'm going to turn the light off and only pulse it in after I've seen flies starting to mate. Note: Flies seem way more eager to copulate / court without the lights constantly on.

Shit that worked better than expected. Fly terminated immediately (5 minutes into cop.)

11/26/2014

- "Out of focus" problem is actually some weird artifact of backlighting and autoadjusting the white balance. I need to fix that.

12/01/2014

- Attempted to break up copulation at 5 minutes in by activating NP5270. Worked for some flies but not others, which showed the same highly variable cop. dur phenotype as before

- Trying again with new stimulus protocol: Only stimulate for 2 seconds out of every 30 seconds with a preprogrammed (let's go with 20 Hz, 5ms) stimulation during that block. (stored as expt. 2)
    Caused one to disengage (of two), other acted more erratically but has not stopped copulating yet (as of 3rd block of light stimulation)
    Fly copulating with dead female also seems unfazed.
    Third fly starting mating after light stimuli started and is exhibiting apparently normal cop. dur. (possibly longer??)

12/02/2014

- Trying copulationg dur in P1b>Chrimson flies with constant light. Kind of tweaks them out, but they do court pretty aggressively. Cop dur. mildly reduced (down to like 14 minutes) and the flies seem to get stuck more easily.

12/06/2014

- Reanalysis of GABA stim during copulation suggests that stim before ~ 5 min has little effect but after ~ 5 minutes causes dismounting. Will need to test this a little more, but it's encouraging.

TODO:
-TH-GAL4, Fru-FLP, UAS->STOP>-TrpA1 cop. dur expts., dissection and staining with anti-myc to look at VNC
-Similar analysis with dsx-FLP
-Varying stimulus levels with cop. dur termination expts.
-Calcium imaging
-Get the IRIS up and running

12/08/2014

- NP5270 stimulation set time into mating again. I didn't realize the Arduino program had been changed so I couldn't control the stimulus the way I wanted. Still, there is a puzzling result: flies which had been copulating for a long time didn't necessarily stop while those which had did.

- Chrimson/+ flies not spooked at all by red light stimulation 5 minutes or more into mating. So that's a plus

12/13/2014

- Attempting TH>Chrimson mating with increased retinal dose. Most flies don't seem super tweaked out, though one is seizing. Forgot to clear out SD card of all the other videos that were on it so now there's some frame skipping (plus I did 30 fps instead of my usual 20, oops). 5 Hz 1 ms stimulus. Seem to have ~ normal copulation duration....
- upped the intensity of stim to 20 hz, 5 ms, though that is definitely freaking the flies out a lot more. This resulted in one average length copulation bout and one very long copulation bout. Terminated video 90 minutes into copulation but it actually lasted a little longer before they started acting stuck. Will try constant light again, since that seemed to work on 11/21

12/15/2014

- TH>TrpA1 and CS; TrpA1 flies copulationg duration tested at 30 degrees. Only one TH fly copulated but it was for > 2.5 hours. The controls all copulated for ~10 minutes. Will try again soon. The flies also look about as tweaked out as they do on Chrimson, so that's not so bad. (MVI_0191-4)

12/16/2014

- Trying NP5270>Chrimson with the increased retinal dose. Flies are a little more jittery than normal but able to initiate copulation and court just fine. Pulsed a 500 ms light pulse every 30 seconds. 4/8 dismounted immediately upon pulse, 3 continued mating and seemed only somewhat affected by subsequent pulses. They certainly react but do not discontinue mating until several pulses later. Cop. dur is much shorter than usual in the nonterminating flies.
- Starving the flies overnight, then feeding them retinal the next day. We'll see how that goes
- Ran NP5270>TrpA1 experiments as well (video says Chrimson but it's TrpA1!) Average cop dur: 8.3 minutes.

12/17/2014

- Two groups of NP5270>Chrimson flies, one which has been on retinal food for a while, one which has been starved and then put on retinal food for 1 hour. Only 3 males present from the starved group (right half). Now testing copulation termination with light. Does not seem significantly improved (only 2 flies copulated, of which 1 terminated on first activation and the second copulated for longer than avergae for NP5270>Chrimson activated flies)

12/18/2014
- Trying NP5270>Chrimson cop. dur again, this time with stimulation throughout. 20 Hz 10 ms. Surprisingly little courtship. Turning off the lights for a bit then I'll switch the light stim to 2 sec on, 18 sec off. Wow huge effect! Scares the shit out of the males. Also does a great job getting the copulating flies to break up. Like, really great job (100% success rate!)

- Control flies with same stimulus setting (200 second freq, 2000 ms pulse width): absolutely no effect on their copulation! Does not initiate sudden termination. success! Cop. dur. also seems normal

12/20/2014
- NP5270>Chrimson cop. dur again, 2000 ms pulses every 200 seconds (0.005 Hz). Works like a dream yet again!
- To confirm it's the GABA line and not generic Chrimson activation, I'm doing dTrpA1>Chrimson in the same experimental prep. The activation certainly bothers the unmating males (have not yet seen successful copulation initiation). These guys are less aggressive courters. Maybe there's some weak tonic Chrimson activation. Red light disconnected until I see some copulation. Okay, uhh so I've been waiting like > 1 hour and got no courtship. These flies are a bunch of
  wimps. Also the males look really small. Not sure what's up.
- Trying TH>Chrimson with 2 second pulses of light every 20 seconds (f = 0.05 Hz). Stimulation kind of jerks the males around a bit, but once they mount the females they become their usual semi-zen selves. One pair so far looks "stuck" (of the two copulating pairs I have). I also observe that weird trademark rearing behavior. Phenotype is still variable: one pair copulated for 45 minutes, one for 19, and one for 25.

12/21/2014
- ddc>Chrimson at .05 Hz 2 s pulses. This seems to tweak the flies out a good deal. I'll dial down the frequency to 0.01 Hz (every 100 seconds). Once they start copulating, light stimulation does not appear to terminate it (at least in the early stages of copulation so far). It does, however, seem to reduce copulation duration in general (closer to 15 minutes), but termination does not coincide necessarily with light onset. Definitely seems like Ddc does not play a role in
  copulation duration. Couldn't get a decent dissection with fluoresence that showed up on Corey's scope though...

- Trying NP2719 (10x backcrossed) > Chrimson with 0.005 Hz 2 second stimuli. Fortunately it works exactly as well (i.e. 100% of the time) even only seconds into mating, and even 3 minutes out, suggesting it's truly the termination signal. Wait, no, there's one fly (well #2) who continued to copulate through the light signal, but terminated copulation twice on preceding matings. Copulated for 20 minutes. Happened in one other fly, but terminated the second time.

- NP5270 repoGAL80 > Chrimson (1000 ms, every 200 seconds). Even this stimulation thus far has a 100% success rate. Will have to repeat without repo-GAL80. But it is kind of interesting: the dismounting procedure takes a few seconds and outlasts the light stimulus.

12/22/2014
-Crz>GAL4 (2 seconds, 0.005 Hz). They definitely respond to crz activation. Not seeing very much courtship but I'll wait. Turned off the light so that it would stop interrupting courtship. Stuck finger into video at first flash AFTER I plugged lights back in. Does not terminate copulation. Upped stimulus to constantly on to see if it had any effect, but does not appear to either. The males do seem to be ejaculating the whole time, though, so I feel good about Chrimson working here.
-NP5270>Chrimson (1 sec, 0.005 Hz). Still sufficient to terminate all copulations. Trying tonic stimulation at 2 Hz 50 ms. i'm at least still seeing some courtship, though it is reduced. Trying it without stimulation for a while. Bringing back the light seems to keep them from copulating much, but if I turn it on after they've started, they stop quickly. The one that started copulating after the lights turned on, however, stayed copulating for a normal amount of time.

01/02/2015
- w;>STOP>TrpA1;Fru-Flp/TH-GAL4 expts. at 32*. Incubator was actually set to 30* (thermometer read 29 when I checked...)
- Remember to do antibody staining after (Pecot lab not around, can't do it today)
- Crz>Chrimson mating followed by IMMEDIATE red light and then heat shock at 41* C. Termination: 0/4 (terminated only a few minutes in though). "100 % termination" according to Vosshall / Crickmore paper, but doesn't quite sit right with me.
- Performing the same assay with CS / TrpA1 flies gives 0% termination (n = 2), so maybe there's something to it. Further, the control flies mate for a normal amount of time

01/03/2015
- Anti-myc stain for w;>STOP>TrpA1-myc;TH-GAL4/Fru-FLP brains / VNCs primary incubated tonight
- Moved over to CLS

01/04/2015

- Anti-myc incubated in donkey anti-mouse AlexaFluor488
- Crz>Chrimson experiments with .0025 Hz stim and 10 s pulses. Haven't put the indicator light back in yet, so you'll have to just deal with that. These guys also don't seem to court that much, and when they do the females seem really unreceptive. Maybe they have gunk / cva on them and that makes them less appealing? Wow, I waited here for hours and not a single one was able to initiate copulation.

01/06/2015

- TH activation of Chrimson kind of stimulated excessive grooming in males wandering around but did not do anything clear.
- TH activation in mating males... couldn't get them to court...

- w;>STOP>TrpA1/+;Fru-FLP/TH-GAL4 at 32* C. Forgot to focus the video, but the copulations I can observe seem normal. Possible the FLP isn't working well

Repeated Crz>Chrimson activation -> heat shock expt. (10 sec Crz activation, 30 sec heat shock, wait 2 min for separation). 0/1 termination

01/09/2015

- NP2719>Chrimson using a 12V power supply instead of 19V. 0.005 Hz, 2000 ms. Terminates some but not all copulations. Switched to high power at 12:34 (33 minutes into recording). Marked by finger. This expt. is to confirm Chrimson is still working in these flies.

- Doing the same expt. again, titled "v2."

01/11/2015

- Trying with 14V power. Adequate to cause early termination every time, stops copulation on the first flash almost every time.

- Now doing 12 V stimulation (only infrequently caused termination when flashed for 2 s every 200 seconds) but 20 ms every second. Animals court normally. They also seem to copulate normally. I guess it takes a prolonged activation of the GABA neurons to get a phenotype. I'll keep trying expts. with different stimulations though.Actually, copulation is considerably longer than normal. If I supply a long strong pulse, though, it makes them all terminate, so it doesn't
  seem like it's the GABA activity per se, but rather the CHANGE in GABA activity. Will do more expts.

- NP5270>GFP experiments with .005 Hz 2000 ms stim (termination assay) at full power (19.2 V). Obviously, does not cause termination with red light onset.

- NP2719>Chrimson in no light has surprisingly short cop. dur. (mean = 16.33 min), but I only tested 3 flies. I'll keep the camera rolling in case I get more flies. These flies are also pretty old. I think I won't use this data and will try it again next time I do the experiment.

-TH>Chrimson Termination assay (19.2 V, 0.005 Hz, 2000 ms). Yet again pretty hard to get copulation with these flies...

- TH-G'>Chrimson grooming assay. Protocol: 5 minutes no red light, measure fraction of time grooming, then 5 minutes red light, measure fraction of time grooming. LEFT HALF: Chrimson/+ RIGHT HALF: TH-G'>Chrimson all flies are males. Results: hard to say. I'll score the video at some point, but for now it looks like red light promotes grooming in control and TH flies...

- Using the same set-up but with the termination assay looking for cop. dur. phenotypes. TH-G'>Chrimson also doesn't seem to want to court as much as the controls do... wow, the raspi crashed. Never seen that happen before. I wonder what happened. Second video obviously starts a few minutes later. Perhaps the previous experiment depleted a good amount of the dopamine in the TH-G' neurons? Finally got a copulation and the male is acting very spastic, constantly pulling on
  the female. He did eventually stabilize though

01/12/2015

- No light controls look good. After I got several copulations, I started playing with various light levels. 11.1 V did nothing with a 2 s stimulation, but with 5 s seems to have slightly more success eliciting a response. Still not a super good at it though.

- Crz>Chrimson heat shock expt. again (15 s in red light, 30 sec at 41*, then wait 2 minutes and see if they broke up). 1/1. Corazonin is easier to activate with 20 Hz, 10 ms stim with the power set to 28.1 V, for future reference.

01/13/2015

- Did 1 Hz 20 ms 12 V expt again, cop. dur. looks more like the controls. Guess the high mean before was just by chance. Not broken retinal because I broke up the termination with a prolonged pulse of red light.

- 10 Hz 20 ms 28 V shortens the cop. dur. but the ones on the far right seem less effected for some reason...

01/14/2015

- 1 Hz 200 ms 28V. NOTE: FIRST TWO AND LAST TWO COLUMNS HAVE ONLY BEEN ON RETINAL FOR ONE DAY. This stim. does seem to cause early termination of copulation, even in the flies which have only been on retinal for a day or less.

01/18/2015

- Been working on PQE. Experiment idea: TH>TrpA1, look to see if they've ejaculated by 10 minutes into copulating (make sure TH activation isn't acting by simply inhibiting Crz neurons)

01/19/2015

- NP2719 10 hz 20 ms stim (28V). No copulation because the females weren't HS'd virgins... oops.

01/21/2015

- Crz>Chrimson with w-eyed virgins. These flies are still hard to get courting (they've been isolated for two whole days and are probably ~ 3 days old...?)

01/22/2015

- NP5270>Chrimson 2 sec stim every 10 minutes. Trying to see if females remain receptive to courtship after cop. between 5-10 minutes (to see if the remaining 10-15 minutes are how long it takes to activate the ppk pathway etc.). They seem to lose receptivity very quickly after ejaculation.

01/24/2015

- Crz>Chrimson heatshock expts again. The 5-day-old males are much more active in terms of courtship, which is nice. Control did not terminate copulation when heat shocked.
Cop dur of non-terminating flies:
1: 3:36 - 3:53 = 17 min

01/25/2015

- TH-G'>Chrimson 0.005 Hz 2000 ms. Short cop. dur?? Only got one fly...

01/27/2015

- BLIZZARD

- Crz>Chrimson early termination expts again. Had one pair that didn't break up during the light stimulation experiment. Mock cop. dur is normal though.

- TH>Chrimson seems relatively ineffective with .005 Hz 2 s stimuli, but 10 Hz 20 ms stimulus did prolong copulation in the one fly I got copulating... (46 min)

01/28/2015

- TH-G>Chrimson 10 Hz 20 ms. The lights kind of tweak the males out and interrupt courtship. The males jerk around more while mating, that's for sure. Much shorter copulation duration, though.

-TH>Chrimson 10 hz 20 ms. Long copulation durations: 70 minutes and 40 minutes. Yay.

01/30/2015

- R40F04>Chrimson 10 Hz 20 ms is sufficient to induce grooming in isolated male flies. Activating these neurons does not stop copulation. It also is sufficient to drive grooming of the eyes during mating. But there's a weird courtship phenotype too.

- R18C11>Chrimson also works with 10 Hz 20 ms

02/03/2015

-Crz>Chrimson no light controls. Mostly normal, but one weird loooong mating pair?? Maybe silenced those neurons...

- TH>Chrimson no light controls. Normal cop. dur.

02/04/2015

- NP2719>Chr 1 Hz 20 ms stimulus. Slightly long cop. dur. than the 10 Hz 20 ms, but shorter than no stimulus.

- NP2719>Chr .01666 Hz 200 ms stim (1 pulse / min). No difference from WT mating! Interesting.

02/05/2015

- R40F04>Chrimson grooming during mating again. Also, weirdly, observe some unilateral wing extension during mating, but not all the time (like one might expect from a CPG).

02/06/2015

-NP2719>Chrimson 1 min 200 ms stim. Weird bimodal result!! Half of the flies terminate within the first 5 minutes or so, and the other half terminate at 20 minutes....

-NP2>Chr 10 Hz 20 ms still the same.

-Trying NP2>Chr 1 Hz 500 ms. Causes termination in every mating immediately except for with a few flies. Only one lasts more than one flash.

- NP2>Chr 1 min 200 ms again. No flies terminated during the first 10 minutes of mating so I switched it up by adding a 1s pulse. None of these guys terminated in response to that, but did respond to a 2s pulse.

02/08/2015

- NP2>Chr .1 Hz 200 ms, termination around 10 min period or at normal interval.

- NP2>Chr 1Hz200ms corroborates previous data

- NP2>Chr no light controls just like before

02/10/2015

- NP2>Chr .1 Hz 200 ms, termination early on, never makes it to normal interval. What went wrong before (or now??). I'll need to repeat these experiments. I would also like to repeat the 1 min 200 ms experiment. Unfortunately, I don't have many NP2 flies right now...

- NP7>Chr 2s pulse causes termination every time.

- NP7>Chr 10Hz 20 ms: Not really getting any courtship. There are just so few flies too.

- NP7,GadGal80>Chr 0.005Hz 2000 ms: Still terminates with light pulse. Does GadGal80 not work or are there other neurons??

- TH-C'>Chrimson 10 Hz 20 ms. The light really makes these guys spazz. I'm just gonna turn off the power supply until a mating starts. Otherwise they display aggression-like behavior. WOW the mating guy FREAKS OUT when you do this. Eventually he starts to display stuck-like behavior (after like 50 minutes) Keeps mating (non-stuck-like) even when I turned off the light though, so I turned it back on. Turned off the light for good after 2 hours of mating to see how long it
  took to dismount. Took only a couple of minuntes to terminate from there.

02/11/2015

- Np2>Chr 1 min 200 Hz a little confusing. Not so much the bimodal distribution. Looks closer to the 1 hz 200 ms data. I feel like I need to figure out the day-to-day variability.

- Chr/+ 1 min 200 Hz looks normal. Slightly higher cop. dur than average but that's not unreasonable. approximately the same amount of spazzing in response to light as in the Np2 flies, so I can be extra confident that it's not a motor defect

02/12/2015

- NP2,GadGal80 with 2s stimulation once a minute. Left 4 flies are Np2Gadgal80>Chr, right 4 are just np2>Chr. Both cause termination. Seems like the GadGal80 doesn't work.

02/13/2015

- PQE!!

02/17/2015

List of experiments I want to do:

- Calcium imaging in GABA neurons
- Calcium imaging in dopamine neurons
- Calcium imaging in Crz neurons
- Measure red light intensity INSIDE the ventral nerve cord of the fly
- Demonstrate similar effects of red light on copulation duration of decapitated flies
- In vivo calcium imaging during Chrimson stimulation
- Ex vivo calcium imaging or ephys with Chrimson stimulation
- Characterize sensitivity of GABA neurons to temporal structure of light inputs
- Characterize dopamine subsets driving copulation / other behaviors
- Create Crz-LexA
- Screen grooming driver circuits for neurons which overcome behavioral suppression
- Automate behavioral analysis

Prioritization:

1) Automate analysis
2) Calcium imaging in GABA / dopamine / Crz
3) Measure red light intensity
4) Dynamics of GABA neuron inputs
5) Dopamine subsets
6) Validate Chrimson in decap. flies
7) Ex vivo calcium imaging + Chrimson
8) IN vivo Ca imaging + Chrimson
9) Screen grooming drivers

Screening isn't super hard though so I'll do it where I can fit it.

- R53E05 : Leg grooming during mating??? Hard to tell.

- R50B07 : No wing grooming during mating, but strong wing grooming outside of mating.

02/22/2015

- Okay it's time to get back to work

- Let's do some behavioral controls:

- 10 Hz 20 ms 16 v : Demonstrate that I'm using "saturating" amounts of light, i.e. the photocurrent is probably the same with 16v as with 28v, as validated by similar copulation durations. The data is not looking great though; I've had 3 flies so far, 2 with shorter than the 28v cop dur and 1 in the normal range. Flies are a bit older than normal though. I'll keep watching and see what the overall distribution looks like. Next few flies look pretty normal. Not sure what to make of
  this. I'll have to repeat it later.

- 0.005 Hz 15000 ms 28v. Demonstrate that mating termination comes from activation of the neurons, rather than a "rebound" phenomenon. All copulations terminate long before the pulse ends. So it's probably not a rebound from a depolarization block or something like that.

02/23/2015

- Trying out Barret Pfeiffer's Chrimson lines #1,2,3,4 with 2s pulses once every 200s. #1 didn't terminate on the first light trial. Instead, terminates around 10 minute mark. #2 terminates every time. #3 also terminates every time. Weaker effect on #4 as well.

02/24/2015

- Redux on yesterday's expts. Pfeiffer lines 1,2,3,4. NOTE: ACCIDENTALLY MIXED UP ORDER. COLUMNS GO 1, 3, 2, 4, AS REFLECTED IN THE NUMBERS SHEET, BUT IT'S HARD TO SEE IN THE VIDEO!!! The 10x ChR88 line is less effective at causing termination (around 10 min in instead of immediately), but the others all seem to work the same, as far as I can tell

02/25/2015

- NP2719 Constant stimulation. I did this experiment before, but with the lower retinal dose. Vivian's lights fall apart after prolonged light stimulus because the solder melts, though, so I'll have to redo this.

- NP2719 0.05 Hz 20 ms. Looks like WT, but expt. is actually invalid. Test 2s pulse failed to cause termination. Will repeat with new flies.

02/26/2015

- Finally got OpenCV and raspicam working together!! It only takes 15 ms to read a frame in OpenCV, but on the Pi it seems to take 2 whole seconds to do the processing. It seems like I will have to unload all the processing to the lab computer. Breakdown:
15 ms to read frame
100 ms to resize frame
~ 200 ms to find well contours
400 ms to find and sort out flies
only a few milliseconds to draw contours
~ 120 ms to write a frame

02/27/2015

- R18C11>Chrimson stimulus elicits antennal grooming in head-ful flies, but no grooming (or possibly a little leg and genital grooming??) in decapitated flies (n=2)

- Did a bunch of TH-G>Chrimson dissections and then turned them into pancakes because the slide coverslips are thinner than the brains!! so the bridge flattened them. Kind of a bummer.

03/02/2015

- NP2719 > Chrimson 0.005 Hz 500 ms. Looking for "lower bound" on instant termination stimulus. (using 28 V) NOTE: Forgot to plug in the power source for the first few minutes. 500 ms appears above threshold

- NP2719 > Chrimson 0.005 Hz 250 ms is sub threshold (also 28 V). Okay cool! So the "threshold" is somewhere in the middle. Exhibits this same "bimodal" behavior I saw in the once-a-minute 200 ms pulses (not super surprising).

03/03/2015

- NP2719 > Chrimson 10 Hz 20 ms stimulus provided in a 10 sec. block every 200s. Looking for a difference between this stimulation condition and the one in which it's constantly 10 Hz 20 ms. Essentially the question is "are the NP2 neurons somehow remembering all of the activity injected during those first ten minutes when they terminate, or is it approximately the instantaneous/within-the-last-few-seconds level of activity that matters?" There IS a marked change: this stimulation
  terminates the mating! So what seems to matter is the relative change in GABA neuron activity....?

- Same expt. as above but with a 1s block every 200s. Even 1s is enough, though it's not as good (it seems). However, it's unclear if it's only working in that 20-30s window of "low motivation" right at the start of mating, since all of the terminations I've observed have been in that window. Ah, no, it's worked in other flies too near the 3 or 4 minute mark. Some flies seem unaffected, which is weird because they terminated in response to the longer pulse. Am going to repeat this
  experiment when they terminate using their brothers.

- NP2719 > Chrimson 10 Hz 20 ms 1 s block every 200 s. This one seems to work (almost) every time. Hmmmm... Still a behavioral effect in the non-terminating flies though. Not using the preceding batch of data, for now at least.

03/04/2015

- TH>GCamp6f 2p recording. Got cut off before I figured out how to take a dang video! But I saw fluoresence, and it was definitely in the green band, and it was sensitive to the 2p excitation (went away if I shortened or lengthened the wavelength too much or if I excluded green from the acquired light, but not any other color). It also seemed to be "pulsing" (like Stephen Zhangs's TH neurons). The fly was still mating at the time (~15 minutes in) as far as I could tell (and he
  had terminated by the time I got back to lab after getting evicted). Hopefully I can get similar images again when I go back

03/09/2015

- NP2719>Chrimson expts. with 10 Hz 20 ms stimulus for 40 minutes, then turning off the light (can I adjust "baseline...?"). Simultaneously recording mating times in those flies which DO mate during the light stim. Ehh looks pretty normal.

- NP2719>GCaMP6f experiments. Didn't see any 2p-sensitive fluoresence... Tried scanning with 488, saw more signal, not clear what came from abd. gang.

- Crz>Chrimson termination expts again. 0/1 termination. These guys just aren't great at courting. Gawd, nothing worked today.

03/11/2015

- Even the dissecting scope light is capable of terminating copulation in np2719>chrimson males, which is going to make the imaging experiments more difficult. Options: do dissection in IR, use ReaChR, use weaker Pfeiffer line, do dissection in ambient light (need to see if opening cuticle will cause termination in this setting)

-Trying cop. dur. in Tph2>Chrimson. They don't seem super excited about courting.... 0.005 Hz, 2000 ms stimulation (28V). They get there though, I'm starting to see some courtship about 10 minutes in. took ~ 20 minutes before I got my first successful copulation. Activation definitely bothers him! Even several seconds after the stimulation, he looks like he's trying to dismount the female. Kind of like the TH phenotype? But it's not a complete dismount like with the
NP2719 line. He seems to return back to normal after ~ a minute. Shit! I went pee and missed whenever he terminated! Fortunately I have the video. I'll watch to see if he terminated on the light pulse. (Yes, he did) Aborted video so I could download it while I record the next one (called the same thing but with a 2 at the end). Shit! some sort of memory allocation issue... not sure what the eff happened.

-Termination expt. in Tph2>Chrimson flies. 0/2 termination. Acts like he's going to terminate, though! Rears back and pulls away from female.

03/12/2015

- Crz>Chrimson termination expt. 0/6 termination. What the shit? was using different stimulus though: 10 hz 20 ms instead of 20 hz 10 ms. Could that make a difference? I'll try it again. Termination with 20 hz 10 ms: 3/5

- Trying with longer heat stimulation (2 min): 2/2 termination, one in the bath, one not. Mock: 0/5

- Worked on separate wells box. Annoyingly, cut out the wrong pieces so I didn't get a chance to finish it today.

- Crz>Chrimson cop. dur. assay with 20 s of 20 Hz 10 ms pulse stimulus every 200s. Tim Tayler paper predicts this should prolong cop. dur. My other expts. predict this should keep cop. dur. the same.

Things for tomorrow:
-BUILD BOX
-Get CrzR null mutant from mike for CrzR / Crz expts.

03/16/2015

-Np2>Chrimson on old food from rogulja lab with retinal in it. Checking to see if 2 s long pulses of activity still terminate the mating. Does not do so. Doesn't seem to have any effect (do I need more retinal? is it too old?)

03/17/2015

- Built box

- Tried to do 2p imaging but the software crashed!!! I lost all of the videos. Ughhh.

03/20/2015

- Still working on box / arduino code for single well control via serial comm.

- Remember to try NP2 > PKC-rnai or PKA inhibitor or whatever.

- Try to make a PCB for making more boxes so that I don't have a mess of wires everywhere.

- Helping SXZ with some expts. Stim. order: 10 hz 20 ms, 1 hz 200 ms, played around a bunch with stim parameters (see indicator light), back to 1 hz 200 ms (file name: 02857Chrimson.h264)

03/22/2015

- The point IR LEDs and diffuser paper don't do a great job of giving a nice even background illumination. I'll try a few more things to improve the situation.

- Activating 10 Hz, 20 ms stimulus immediately after mating begins does not seem to have an effect immediately. Rather, it takes ~ 1 minute to cause termination. They aren't courting very successfully though so I have very few samples.

- Actually, it does seem to cause instantaneous termination in some flies. Yikes.

- 10 Hz 1 ms stimulus, on the other hand, does not cause instant termination. The flies are pretty freaked out by it for the first ~1 minute of stimulation, but then they calm back down and go for a pretty normal time. This is consistent with some of the older results I was getting, where activating the NP2 neurons either caused quite early termination or termination at the normal time. I feel like this might actually be a real effect.

- Surprisingly, the same stimulus (10 hz, 1 ms) seems to cause a shorter cop. dur in the tonic stim. case, when light is supplied before and during mating. Fuck, I accidentally deleted that video though

- Testing the effects of NP2 stimulation 8 minutes into mating (instead of right off the bat) using the same 10 Hz 20 ms stimulation. Causes instant termination.

- Did some 2p imaging:
    TH>6f non-mating male, saw no signal (could just be dead though)
    NP2>6m non-mating, no signal
    2>6f mating, have several time-series of a single plane, but it was hard to see much of anything. Here's what I wrote while taking the time series:
        Recording starts at 11:00 into mating
        Switched to 1p after 8 min (couldn't see signal in 2p)
        Switched to 20x lens after another 2 min
        Frequently had to adjust focal plane
        Fluoresence seems to increase as time goes on, but it's hard to say for sure
        Not confident I was recording from AG after I zoomed out and looked around a bit and found something that looked more AG-like that had some baseline fluoresence
        Noticed that the ringer evaporated by like 40 min into recording. Will need to be cognizant of this possible issue.

03/23/2015

- Rebuilt box with non-reflective material but it was sized too small. Will have to re-do that...

- TH-G>Chrimson expts, 10 hz 20 ms at start of mating. Also has short copulation duration phenotype in three of five flies tested.

03/24/2015

- TH>Chrimson expt, 10 hz 20 ms at start of mating. The single well prep is so much better! In one experiment I can get more flies than I got total in my other TH experiments. They definitely still perform the spazzy rearing while mating though. The mating duration is much longer than WT flies still, which is encouraging. Saw some frame skipping, which was annoying, so I started a new video. I think the frame skipping came from all the extra processing adjusting
the video when I was messing with background illumination though

- Crz>Chrimson flies heat responsiveness to 37* after Crz activation (0/3 immediately after Crz activation), (1/2 5 minutes after), (1/1 10 minutes after)

 NP2 > 6f, tried with two mating flies, saw no calcium signal. Really frustrating.

03/25/2015

- NP2>Chrimson mating stim test. Just checking that the flies are still responsive to the same inputs in the new rig, for now. Starting with a single pulse of 500 ms 1 min into mating, terminates every time. A single 250 ms pulse, on the other hand, terminates 15 times out of 23 when applied within a minute of mating initiation.

- NP2>Chrimson 10 minutes into mating. A 250 ms long pulse causes mating 0/5 times! Interesting. These data seem to go along with the previous data in which neurons were far less excitable in the intermediate period. Repeating it gives me one more fly, with the same effect

- NP2>Chrimson 15 minutes into mating, 250 ms single pulse terminates 0/6 times.

03/26/2015

- NP2>Chrimson 10 minutes into mating with a single 500 ms pulse also does not seem to cause termination (1/8 flies) but does increase cop. dur. (5/7 non-interrupted matings)

- NP2>Chrimson 15 minutes into mating with a single 500 ms pulse. Also does not cause termination. Accidentally hit the wrong key on well #1 and caused a long stim though, which did induce termination at 15 min

- NP2>Chrimson no light controls look normal

- NP2>Chrimson 1s stim 10 minutes into mating. Even this isn't strong enough to get termination every time! Jeez.

03/27/2015

- NP2>Chrimson 1 s stim 15 minutes into mating terminates the mating 1/4 times. Wow. Also the cop. dur. seems a little longer yet again.

- Trying Crz>Chrimson heat shock expts (37*) and CS heat shock expts. (41*):
    Crz   ( 0/3 ) 1 min    ( 0/3 ) 5 min     ( 2/3 ) 10 min     ( 1/1 ) 15 min
    CS    ( 0/5 ) 5 min    ( 0/8 ) 10 min    ( 3/6 ) 15 min     ( 4/4 ) 20 min

    In the Crz flies, they seem to be much more responsive to the threat even if they don't terminate (in those early time points like 5 or 10 minutes), as opposed to the CS flies which do not care at all

03/29/2015

- NP2>Chrimson 2s stim 10 minutes into mating terminates 8/8 times. However, watch the recording for the fly in well 1; he takes up to 10 s after the stimulus to dismount! Need to think about this a little bit.

- NP2>Chrimson 1s stim 10 minutes into mating again. A few more successes (3/6) than last time I did this experiment, still not 100%. Definitely distinguishable from the 2s stim.

- Crz>Chrimson no light controls at 41 degrees

    Mock   ( 0/5 ) 1 min    ( 1/5 ) 5 min     ( 4/4 ) 10 min     ( 2/2 ) 15 min

    seems more reasonable than those WT expts before. The CS flies had been isolated for a very long time though

- Crz>Chrimson light on (20 hz 10 ms) for 30 s when mating starts, test at 41 degrees 5 minutes into mating. Terminates ( 7/8 )

- NP2>Chrimson 1s stim 15 minutes into mating. Still fairly low termination rate (3/6)

- NP2>Chrimson 500 ms stim 5 minutes into mating. Terminates (almost) every time ( 9/11 ). I think this whole "epoch" idea might be right; plausibly something about the Crz / ejaculation signal (is it through Crz / Tph2+ neurons?)

- NP2>Chrimson 1s stim 5 minutes in. Still doesn't terminate every time (7/12). Collecting females from non-terminating matings to see if they produce larva

- NP2>6s,TdT recordings: 1st one starts at 12 min into mating, 2nd one starts at 21 min into mating

03/30/2015

- NP2>G6s,TdT images show a lot more fluoresence than I'd like

- TH-G>Chrimson-mVenus VNC shows pretty heavy expresion

03/31/2015

- Got NSF!

- NP2>Chr-mVen 1s stim 1 min into mating causes termination almost every time (14/15)

- NP2>Chr-mVen 1s stim 5 min into mating causes termination almost every time as well ( 8/9 )

- NP2>Chr-mVen 1s stim 10 min into mating does not cause termination every time (terminates 2/6 flies). I still see the same slight increase in copulation duration as I observed before.

- NP2>Chr-mVen 1s stim 15 min into mating. Only one mating pair! Responsive to light stimulus, but doesn't seem to break up until like a minute later

- Tried to do 2p with NP2>TdT,G6s, only one successful mating fly. Unfortunately, he dismounted partway through the (beautiful!) dissection so there's no gcamp signal, though the abd. gang. looks really nice.

04/01/2015

- Worked on lab meeting

- Crz>Chrimson experiment where I pulse in 20 Hz 10 ms light for 30s every 5 minutes into mating (so at 5, 10, 15 min etc.). One thing I notice about these flies is that they seem to court just fine, and the females seem receptive, but they have some trouble mounting. The motion looks normal, but they give up on it fairly quickly. Didn't actually get a successful mating!

- Crz>Chrimson tried again and got a mating. Last 25 minutes with this protocol

- Lab meeting

- Interesting expts:
    
    GABA neurons:
        Is the "adaptation" GABA neuron autonomous? "Paired pulse" expt. isn't perfect but might be suggestive
        Along the same lines, try superimposing a single pulse over a gradual ramp of input (to show that it relies on the recent history of GABA spiking)
        Good expt: Show that it's mediated by a specific molecule within the GABA neurons (use a knockdown in just NP2). Possible candidates: ACh receptors, GABAB receptor, CrzR

    Crz neurons:
        Obviously try to get Ca activity
        Use ChaT-RNAi or Crz-RNAi, look for effect on persistence (responsiveness to heat)
        Flesh out controls
    DA:
        Work on subpopulations (TH-Gal4, C-Gal80 cop dur. e.g.)
        Try to do pale knockdown in TH-G to see if cop. dur. shortening is due to DA release in these neurons

- Running TH>Chrimson no light controls

- Also trying to get more flies with the 15 min pulse (NP2719>Chrimson single pulse at 15 minutes into mating). These females are just super duper non-receptive.Both the TH>Chrimson expts and NP2 experiments are getting no copulations

04/04/2015

- Running Crz>CrzRNAi flies to look for cop dur. phenotype. Males have presumably only been isolated for one day so I may have to do this experiment again, but I'll see what cop durs I get. Lots of them mated though so I'm not super worried about their mating drive! Copulation duration seems normal though. Will separate out females and check fecundity.

- Females from pairs which do not separate due to a 1s pulse of red light at 5 minutes into mating with NP2>Chrimson flies are not fertilized (0/2 flies produce larva)

- Crz>CrzRNAi flies heat shock (41 degrees) at 10 minutes (with the 30 s of 20 Hz 10 ms red light stimulation starting at 30 s into mating) Terminates: ( 3 / 3 ) sooooo the Crz neuropeptide seems to have nothing to do with anything. We'll see about the fecundity thing though

- Crz>Chrimson flies heatshock expts. again. Getting more data for 37 degree curve

Light   5 min ( 3/5 )     10 min ( 1/1 )
Mock    1 min ( 0/2 )      5 min ( 0/3 )     10 min ( 8/8 )    15 min ( / )

surprisingly even the mock treatment seems to terminate at the 10 minute time point every time. Kind of frustrating. I'll do this expt. again in the future

- NP2719>Chrimson 1 s stim at 15 minutes into mating. Terminates ( 2/6 )

- NP2719>Chrimson 2s stim at 15 minutes into mating. Oh shit! I had one not terminate! Uh oh. Terminates ( 1/2 ) Ugh but he's not responsive to any light; maybe this guys have just been kept in the same vial without new retinal for too long. (been like 2 weeks)

- TH>Chrimson no light control looks pretty normal

04/05/2015

- Copied from my notes on the scope today:
    2>6s,tdt:
        - Male died during dissection, looking to see if there's signal anyways
            No apparent 2p signal
            No apparent 1p signal
            TdTomato looks good
            See videos labeled "dead male"
            Under scope and imaging within ~ 5 minutes of death
        - Another termination, did not put under scope
        - 3rd male made it under the scope while mating, but I still couldn't see any GCaMP signal. Hard to find VNC as well, but a little skeptical about gcamp's presence in the cells from this cross.

- NP2719>Chrimson 10 Hz 20 ms stimulation tonic (during courtship and copulation) to reproduce previous results and increase N. Looks pretty similar, a little more variable.

- NP2719>Chrimson 10 Hz 20ms turned off 5 minutes into mating in single well chambers. No matings.... 

- NP2719 repo-Gal80>35547 (PKI) in left half, NP2719 repo-Gal80>35549 (PKI) in right half. Video is called NP2PKI.h264. 35547 males seem a little bit more finicky during mating, but not exceptionally so (as far as I can tell...). Normal copulation duration in 35547 (20 min, 21 min) and 35549 (20 min).

- Trying NP2719>Chrimson 10 Hz 20 ms turned off 5 minutes into mating again. No mating for an hour, but as soon as I turn off the light they start engaging in a lot more courtship behavior.

- Also doing another tonic stim 10 hz 20 ms expt (NP2719Chrimson10hz20ms2.h264) No mating in this expt or the one above. Super annoying.

- Swapped both of the above expts to 1 hz 20 ms instead (this time turning off the light at 10 min for the single well expt.)

- Females mated to crz>crz-rnai males do produce larva (9/10 matings) So I guess Crz does nothing...

- Tph2>Chrimson expts, 10 Hz 20 ms stimulation starting at 2 minutes into mating. These flies are reluctant to court... annoying.

- NP2Chrimson no retinal flies 10 hz 20ms. These flies are also not courting much, but I think they're juveniles so that explains that. I can redo these in a few days. Maybe it's my sick-person breath, too, which will also hopefully be better in a few days... Only two matings, lasting 17 min and 13 min. Surprisingly short. Like I said, I'll do more expts tomorrow

04/10/2015

- Happy birthday!

- NP2719>Chrimson no retinal 10 hz 20 ms stim. Normal copulation duration. Excluding data from old set

- dsx40A05>Chrimson turned on 1 min into mating, 2s pulse of light. Flies have trouble mounting the female it seems??? Courtship seems to go prettyw ell but when they to climb on top, they are not successful. holy shit activating the neurons just like... wrecks the males!

- dsx42G02>Chrimson , 2s stim pulses also cause a bit of a freakout / freezeup. These guys are also having trouble mating. Maybe it's something to do with the arena...

- Another NP2719>Chr no ret 10 hz 20 ms control, also normal cop. dur

04/13/2015

- Holy crap why am I still sick...

- NP2719>Chrimson 2s pulse 15 min into mating. Terminates 2/2

- CrzR01 null tested for mating duration

04/15/2015

- Testing out the A2-flp line and the >>ChrimsonTdt line. Only one fly, but will supply a 2s pulse when he starts mating in Well 6. For the sake of efficiency, I'm going to do other genotypes in the other wells (NP2719>Chrimson-mVenus, 2s pulses at the 15 minute time point). A2 line does not terminate in response to a 2s pulse (!!!) though it does react like it wants to terminate (this is in the TH-C'>Chrimson video). The NP2 flies, in contrast, all terminate

- Crz>Chrimson light at 30 s into mating, 37 degrees at 5 minutes (terminates 3/3), no light cntrl (terminates 0/1), 41 degree no light (term 1/1)

- NP2719>Chrimson-mVen no light controls

- Crz>Chrimson no retinal but + light at 10 minutes into mating (terminates 1/1 )

- TH-C'>Chrimson 10 hz 20 ms starting 1 minute into mating. well 6 is still NP2RepoGal80A2Flp>Chrimson-tdT (trying to get that one to mate). Results in long mating, though not as long as when I did it before. Looks more like the regular TH phenotype now

- TH-G>Chrimson-mVenus brains and VNCs dissected out and incubated with anti-GFP antibody

04/16/2015

- Tph2>Chrimson cop. dur., 10 Hz 20 ms activation starting 30s into mating. Only have two ready adult flies though, and they don't seem to be very active courters

- NP2>Chr-mVen no light controls look normal.

- NP2>Chr-mVen, light on during courtship (10 hz 20 ms) but off after 2 minutes of mating. Couldn't get any successful matings to happen.

RE: CAP ANTIBODY FROM HANNAH:::
    Dilute it to 6 parts in 50 for final incubation. This is a 1:750 mix
    Incubate it in 1:500 anti-rabbit Alexa488 Lifetec Ref: A21206 lot: 1182675

- NP2>Chr-mVen 1s pulse at 7 min into mating. Acts very bothered by the light pulse, even if it does not terminate. Terminates ( 0/3 ). Continues to look agitated even minutes later. Second pulse at 10 min, (terminates 1/2)
