- Sent Dragana fly stocks for Chrimson (BSC 55134-9)
- Practiced dissection of ventral nerve cord in adult males
- LED and optics under consideration:
	Luxeon Rebel LED
	LEDEngin LEDs (Expensive!!)
	Polymer Optics Collimators 
	Carclo Lenses
	Khatod Circular Beam Optic

- Ordered 26 Carclo frosted square optics and 26 Luxeon Rebels

06/23/2014

- Practiced dissection of mating flies

06/24/2014

- Flies are really reluctant to do any mating
- Returned Carclo frosted square optics in favor of Carclo 20 mm narrow beams
- Purchased: 5 700 mA non-adjustable BuckPucks, 12"x12" aluminum sheet
- Made a pretty fruit fly

06/25/2014

- Ordered deep red Luxeon LEDs premounted on Endor Star 1-UP mounts
- Practiced abdominal ganglion dissection

06/26/2014

- Mounted Luxeon LEDs arrived with Carclo lens holders (no lenses or sink yet)
- Adjusted LightChamber.svg (.svg file with schematic of optogenetics chamber)
  to accomodate the Carclo lenses
- Practiced abdominal ganglion prep

06/27/2014

- Lenses and aluminum arrived from LEDSupply. BuckPucks were not dimmable
  so I took 4 750 mA dimmable BuckPucks from Ofer and Pavel.

- Cut aluminum heat sink from aluminum sheet, glued mounted lenses to mounted
  LEDs using Loctite instant adhesive, affixed LEDs/lenses to aluminum heat
  sink using thermal epoxy after wiring LEDs together.

- LEDs are connected 6 in series to a BuckPuck

- Practiced abdominal ganglion dissection

06/28/2014

- Fly food for UAS-ReaChR stock was wet and I didn't notice any eggs or larva
  so I transfered most of the surviving flies to a new food vial

- Crossed UAS-mCherry-ReaChR (II) to TH-C'-GAL4, DDC-GAL4, and TH-GAL4 lines

- Wrote code to operate LED array (titled FlashingLights contained in this
  github repository)

07/01/2014

- Soldered together Buckpuck inputs for LED array (should be completely ready)

- Practiced abd. gang. prep

07/02/2014

- Attempted imaging NP5270 > UAS-GCaMP3.0 - UAS-tdTomato in abd. gangl. of an isolated male glued to a slide. Green visible but
  no obvious dynamics. Will reattempt

- Two Elav-C155; UAS-Dicer2/Cy0 x UAS-ReaChR offspring placed in optogenetics chamber. No obvious response from very superficial examination. 
  Notes: Need to change sheet under the doors so that flies can't crawl between chambers. Chambers are maybe too tall (allow flies  climb on walls). Should try again when I receive the higher power supply. Also consider refitting chamber with higher power LED   arrays (e.g. 3UP deep reds from Luxeon). Also keep in mind that ReaChR is less red-shifted than Chrimson and I bought LEDs        spec'd for Chrimson. When I have more than two flies I'll try this experiment again (hopefully tomorrow?? possibly later today)

- Wilson lab has Chrimson flies; maybe I'll try those?

- Reattempted abdominal ganglion imaging in isolated male fly. Expression pattern appeared to be normal. Will re-do with more spec  ific GAL4 driver tomorrow.

07/03/2014

- Reimaged NP5270 > UAS-GCaMP 3.0 male during mating (attempted). Dismounted during prep. Unable to see much fluoresence??? Bizarre

- UAS-ReaChR flies also unsuccessful again. Hard to say, though, since flies could use the aforementioned design flaw to escape the box entirely (and seemed very interested in doing so).

07/04/2014

- Power cable for LED array set up (3 A, >18V are minimum requirements)

- Dissection of NP5270 > UAS-GCaMP 3.0 isolated male. Fluoresence looked fine.

07/08/2014

- Relative dearth of fluorescent male flies lately for abd. gang. prep

- Inspected mCherry fluoresence in ddc-GAL4>UAS-ReaChR-mCherry stocks; some fluorescent cells but not as many as I expect. I'll check the other GAL4-driven ReaChR stocks too

- Chrimson-mVenus lines arrived (UAS and LexAop2)

07/13/2014

- Realized a few days ago that I forgot to feed the ReaChR flies retinal

- ReaChR offspring put on all-trans-retinal on the 11th. Will attempt experiment again on the 14th

- Crossed Chrimson lines to various dopaminergic GAL4 lines (TH-D', TH-C', ddc, TH)

- Elav-Chrimson cross on the 11th

07/14/2014

- No fluoresence visible now in the NP2719 > GCamP3.0 - mCherry males??

- ddc>ReaChR flies tested again under red LEDs. Possible response? Needs to be quantitatively analyzed

- Possible hurdles:
	Hard to see flies on LEDs in video (change camera settings?? do post-processing?)
	Not clear if expression is good (will do brain dissection on flies shortly)

- Crossed NP5270 to TH-GAL4. Intend to drive TrpA1 in both sets of neurons simultaneously to see whether they "compete" or if they're organized hierarchically (in DECAPITATED flies; in Crickmore/Vosshall they did this in normal flies and saw that the GABAergic line wins out but the cop. dur. seems to more closely resemble WT than either individually).	

07/15/2014

- Set up crosses of both GABAergic lines to all 3 types of GCaMP6 (F,M,S)

- Try to do simultaneous TrpA1 / Chrimson? Maybe Chrimson + ReaChR (use separable LED spectra)?

- Maybe we can try QuaSaR too??

07/21/2014

- Thorlabs shortpass 550 nm? filter affixed to front of camera, blocks all LED light so we can see the flies moving around

07/22/2014

- TH>Chrimson 20 Hz 30 ms pulse width successfully drives retinal-fed flies into seizures but does not appear to affect non-retinal-fed flies. Video file MVI_0057.MP4 on 07/22/2014

07/23/2014

- ddc>Chrimson 20 Hz 30 ms run (fill in results when done)

08/14/2014

- Finally back from Alaska

- NP5270 > UAS-GCaMP6M produces visible green fluoresence in abd. gang. in dissected non-mating male. Green washes out after a while. Unsuccessful dissections so far trying to get mating males I can image

- Peltier units arrived; will begin prototype heating exp. environment shortly.

08/19/2014

- I've been pretty bad about keeping a good lab notebook. Hopefully I can change that here.

- Remember to keep track of Chrimson + double balancer crosses! Goal: produce Chrimson/Cy0 stock and Chrimson/Sb stock.

- ddc and TH > Chrimson experiments stored in the last several days. 10 Hz 10 ms pulses and 5 Hz 5 ms pulses both seem sufficient to induce behavior without causing seizing. Need to do controls for paralysis!! Behaviors which could be induced during red light to demonstrate lack of paralysis include courtship or a fear response to an aversive stimulus (e.g. heat from Peltier units or a visual loom stimulus).

- ddc > Chrimson induces rapid place preference, apparently. But the memory is not retained when the red light is shut off, so maybe place preference isn't the right word; rather, it's just a sense of enjoying the sensation (10 hz 10 ms)

- TH>Chrimson causes an apparent aversive reaction at both 10 hz 10 ms and 5 hz 5 ms. Flies scuttle about frantically whenever they enter the red light until they manage to exit it (and sometimes continue panicking for a bit). They learn fairly quickly not to stand where the light is.

- Do the flies have a sense of where they are in space? Are there even sufficient visual cues to guide them?

- Apparent green fluoresence in a FEW abd. gang. cells driving GCaMP6M with NP5270 repoGal80 (the driver with more broad expression across the whole VNC)

- Need to work on Peltier device!!

-w;TH-C'/+;UAS-Chrimson-mVenus/+ experiment with 10 Hz 10 ms stimulation, alternating at 10 min (accidentally set the right half to 19 Hz, 10 ms! Let's see how that turns out)
-Above expt: 19 Hz, 10 ms causes seizures (no surprise). 10 hz 10 ms is still evidently quite negative.

-TH-C' > Chrimson expt. with SAME FLIES at 5 Hz, 5 ms. Light stimulus again alternates. The flies go bonkers!

-Same genotype as above, 10 Hz 5 ms (NOTE: accidental bug in code I just wrote meant that the startup of the light flashing went a little weird, so I paused the video to fix it. Thus there's a jump at ~10:10 in the video)

08/26/2014

-ddc>Chrimson NO RETINAL 10 hz 5 ms alternating at 10 min. First expt. done by manually turning on lights. Second round done with new Arduino script which turns on lights on its own (so I don't startle the flies)

-Wireless streaming of flies in a box using Raspberry Pi
-Set up Raspberry Pi <--> Arduino USB communication using Nanpy. (NOTE: Arduino code for RasPis should be written in Python using Nanpy; importing other code onto the Arduino will remove the firmware and its ability to communicate with the RasPi via USB)

-Thermistor + heat complex works but the current through the Peltiers (700 mA) is insufficient to dramatically heat the chamber. Will need higher current loads with better parts
-Imaging facility response (FINALLY), will need to wait for Tony Hill to come back from vacation (October 7th)
-New box: Pavel ran out of black acrylic, will order more from McMaster-Carr
-Analysis pipeline: Can do streaming for Raspi videos but have not done motion tracking (yet).
-Lots of GAL4 > Chrimson lines are ready to go; just need the camera set-up to be available too. Should prioritize that until the new parts come in

09/26/2014

- TH > Chrimson experiment performed (file name is THTrialRun.h264), 5 Hz 5 ms stimulus (purportedly; needs to be tested better)
- Upon revision, it apparently takes approximately 200 ms for the Python script to cycle through all the lights (REALLY?) That explains the seizing. So I guess I should rewrite everything to be a bit more pythonic
TODO:
As above

10/01/2014

- TH>Chrimson experiment (5 Hz 5 ms stim with 5 minute switch time) saved as THChrimsonOct1.h264

10/02/2014

- ddc>Chrimson 5 hz 5 ms nice phenotype! Not analyzed but looks good, could use for Mike (saved as ddcChrimson5Hz5ms.h264)

11/09/2014

- So much for being a lot more diligent about this thing.

- 10 Hz 1 ms stimulation of NP5270>Chrimson males copulating with Elav females terminates copulation early (n=4). Will repeat experiment multiple times today, try different stimuli (also toying with lighting)
- 5 Hz 1 ms does the same.
Data in NP5270ChrimsonCopulation spreadsheet
-EscapeNewLights.h264 contains responses of GCI stimulation starting with 25 Hz then off, then 1 Hz, 5 Hz, 10 Hz, 25 Hz stimuli. (pw 5 ms)

11/11/2014

-10 Hz 1 ms stimulus causes seizure in TH>Chrimson as before, dialed down to 10 Hz 300 us stimulus for expts. Slightly erratic male behavior but not so bad. No apparent effect on copulation duration!!

-20 Hz 5 ms seemed to tweak them out too much, switched to 1 ms after a few minutes. We'll see... Male courts a dead female with this stimulus though.
No such luck. Huh. Will dissect TH>Chrimson flies to check expression.
- Dissection looked good! Even more puzzling... will try again with lower settings after flies have had some time to recover

-10Hz1ms Chrimson/+ flies copulate normally (see video). 
Side note: Second mating in the same ~1 hour seems to be shorter in duration than the first

-10Hz1ms NP5270>Chrimson flies has mild effect on copulation duration, but hard to say for sure.

-10Hz 1ms NP5270>Chrimson (NO RETINAL) flies: No effect

11/12/2014

- 10Hz 1ms NP5270>Chrimson flies NO retinal: Still no effect

11/21/2014

- Trying TH>Chrimson again. Flies seem a little jumpy and weird even without light stimulation. Constant light stim makes flies much jumpier but does not seem to have experiment-ruining effects yet. Will update with cop. durs. Does dramatically prolong copulation. Will have to try with less intense stim.

- NP5270>Chrimson constant light stim: shortens copulation in 3 out of 4 flies

11/25/2014

- Trying NP5270>Chrimson. video out of focus for some unknown reason? Will adjust after expt. is finished. Stimulus: Constant red light. Flies are a little jumpier but doesn't seem to be devastating yet. Two copulating pairs, one 8 minutes and one 16 minutes. Maybe some adaptation to red light in Chrimson? Will try again with 20 Hz stim after lunch.

- 20 Hz 1 ms: activated on flies which were previously copulating, male fly starts trying to break up. Not sure how long into copulation they were though.

Changing the setup a little at 1:45: I'm going to turn the light off and only pulse it in after I've seen flies starting to mate. Note: Flies seem way more eager to copulate / court without the lights constantly on.

Shit that worked better than expected. Fly terminated immediately (5 minutes into cop.)

11/26/2014

- "Out of focus" problem is actually some weird artifact of backlighting and autoadjusting the white balance. I need to fix that.

12/01/2014

- Attempted to break up copulation at 5 minutes in by activating NP5270. Worked for some flies but not others, which showed the same highly variable cop. dur phenotype as before

- Trying again with new stimulus protocol: Only stimulate for 2 seconds out of every 30 seconds with a preprogrammed (let's go with 20 Hz, 5ms) stimulation during that block. (stored as expt. 2)
    Caused one to disengage (of two), other acted more erratically but has not stopped copulating yet (as of 3rd block of light stimulation)
    Fly copulating with dead female also seems unfazed.
    Third fly starting mating after light stimuli started and is exhibiting apparently normal cop. dur. (possibly longer??)

12/02/2014

- Trying copulationg dur in P1b>Chrimson flies with constant light. Kind of tweaks them out, but they do court pretty aggressively. Cop dur. mildly reduced (down to like 14 minutes) and the flies seem to get stuck more easily.

12/06/2014

- Reanalysis of GABA stim during copulation suggests that stim before ~ 5 min has little effect but after ~ 5 minutes causes dismounting. Will need to test this a little more, but it's encouraging.

TODO:
-TH-GAL4, Fru-FLP, UAS->STOP>-TrpA1 cop. dur expts., dissection and staining with anti-myc to look at VNC
-Similar analysis with dsx-FLP
-Varying stimulus levels with cop. dur termination expts.
-Calcium imaging
-Get the IRIS up and running

12/08/2014

- NP5270 stimulation set time into mating again. I didn't realize the Arduino program had been changed so I couldn't control the stimulus the way I wanted. Still, there is a puzzling result: flies which had been copulating for a long time didn't necessarily stop while those which had did.

- Chrimson/+ flies not spooked at all by red light stimulation 5 minutes or more into mating. So that's a plus

12/13/2014

- Attempting TH>Chrimson mating with increased retinal dose. Most flies don't seem super tweaked out, though one is seizing. Forgot to clear out SD card of all the other videos that were on it so now there's some frame skipping (plus I did 30 fps instead of my usual 20, oops). 5 Hz 1 ms stimulus. Seem to have ~ normal copulation duration....
- upped the intensity of stim to 20 hz, 5 ms, though that is definitely freaking the flies out a lot more. This resulted in one average length copulation bout and one very long copulation bout. Terminated video 90 minutes into copulation but it actually lasted a little longer before they started acting stuck. Will try constant light again, since that seemed to work on 11/21

12/15/2014

- TH>TrpA1 and CS; TrpA1 flies copulationg duration tested at 30 degrees. Only one TH fly copulated but it was for > 2.5 hours. The controls all copulated for ~10 minutes. Will try again soon. The flies also look about as tweaked out as they do on Chrimson, so that's not so bad. (MVI_0191-4)

12/16/2014

- Trying NP5270>Chrimson with the increased retinal dose. Flies are a little more jittery than normal but able to initiate copulation and court just fine. Pulsed a 500 ms light pulse every 30 seconds. 4/8 dismounted immediately upon pulse, 3 continued mating and seemed only somewhat affected by subsequent pulses. They certainly react but do not discontinue mating until several pulses later. Cop. dur is much shorter than usual in the nonterminating flies.
- Starving the flies overnight, then feeding them retinal the next day. We'll see how that goes
- Ran NP5270>TrpA1 experiments as well (video says Chrimson but it's TrpA1!) Average cop dur: 8.3 minutes.

12/17/2014

- Two groups of NP5270>Chrimson flies, one which has been on retinal food for a while, one which has been starved and then put on retinal food for 1 hour. Only 3 males present from the starved group (right half). Now testing copulation termination with light. Does not seem significantly improved (only 2 flies copulated, of which 1 terminated on first activation and the second copulated for longer than avergae for NP5270>Chrimson activated flies)

12/18/2014
- Trying NP5270>Chrimson cop. dur again, this time with stimulation throughout. 20 Hz 10 ms. Surprisingly little courtship. Turning off the lights for a bit then I'll switch the light stim to 2 sec on, 18 sec off. Wow huge effect! Scares the shit out of the males. Also does a great job getting the copulating flies to break up. Like, really great job (100% success rate!)

- Control flies with same stimulus setting (200 second freq, 2000 ms pulse width): absolutely no effect on their copulation! Does not initiate sudden termination. success! Cop. dur. also seems normal

12/20/2014
- NP5270>Chrimson cop. dur again, 2000 ms pulses every 200 seconds (0.005 Hz). Works like a dream yet again!
- To confirm it's the GABA line and not generic Chrimson activation, I'm doing dTrpA1>Chrimson in the same experimental prep. The activation certainly bothers the unmating males (have not yet seen successful copulation initiation). These guys are less aggressive courters. Maybe there's some weak tonic Chrimson activation. Red light disconnected until I see some copulation. Okay, uhh so I've been waiting like > 1 hour and got no courtship. These flies are a bunch of
  wimps. Also the males look really small. Not sure what's up.
- Trying TH>Chrimson with 2 second pulses of light every 20 seconds (f = 0.05 Hz). Stimulation kind of jerks the males around a bit, but once they mount the females they become their usual semi-zen selves. One pair so far looks "stuck" (of the two copulating pairs I have). I also observe that weird trademark rearing behavior. Phenotype is still variable: one pair copulated for 45 minutes, one for 19, and one for 25.

12/21/2014
- ddc>Chrimson at .05 Hz 2 s pulses. This seems to tweak the flies out a good deal. I'll dial down the frequency to 0.01 Hz (every 100 seconds). Once they start copulating, light stimulation does not appear to terminate it (at least in the early stages of copulation so far). It does, however, seem to reduce copulation duration in general (closer to 15 minutes), but termination does not coincide necessarily with light onset. Definitely seems like Ddc does not play a role in
  copulation duration. Couldn't get a decent dissection with fluoresence that showed up on Corey's scope though...

- Trying NP2719 (10x backcrossed) > Chrimson with 0.005 Hz 2 second stimuli. Fortunately it works exactly as well (i.e. 100% of the time) even only seconds into mating, and even 3 minutes out, suggesting it's truly the termination signal. Wait, no, there's one fly (well #2) who continued to copulate through the light signal, but terminated copulation twice on preceding matings. Copulated for 20 minutes. Happened in one other fly, but terminated the second time.

- NP5270 repoGAL80 > Chrimson (1000 ms, every 200 seconds). Even this stimulation thus far has a 100% success rate. Will have to repeat without repo-GAL80. But it is kind of interesting: the dismounting procedure takes a few seconds and outlasts the light stimulus.

12/22/2014
-Crz>GAL4 (2 seconds, 0.005 Hz). They definitely respond to crz activation. Not seeing very much courtship but I'll wait. Turned off the light so that it would stop interrupting courtship. Stuck finger into video at first flash AFTER I plugged lights back in. Does not terminate copulation. Upped stimulus to constantly on to see if it had any effect, but does not appear to either. The males do seem to be ejaculating the whole time, though, so I feel good about Chrimson working here.
-NP5270>Chrimson (1 sec, 0.005 Hz). Still sufficient to terminate all copulations. Trying tonic stimulation at 2 Hz 50 ms. i'm at least still seeing some courtship, though it is reduced. Trying it without stimulation for a while. Bringing back the light seems to keep them from copulating much, but if I turn it on after they've started, they stop quickly. The one that started copulating after the lights turned on, however, stayed copulating for a normal amount of time.

01/02/2015
- w;>STOP>TrpA1;Fru-Flp/TH-GAL4 expts. at 32*. Incubator was actually set to 30* (thermometer read 29 when I checked...)
- Remember to do antibody staining after (Pecot lab not around, can't do it today)
- Crz>Chrimson mating followed by IMMEDIATE red light and then heat shock at 41* C. Termination: 0/4 (terminated only a few minutes in though). "100 % termination" according to Vosshall / Crickmore paper, but doesn't quite sit right with me.
- Performing the same assay with CS / TrpA1 flies gives 0% termination (n = 2), so maybe there's something to it. Further, the control flies mate for a normal amount of time

01/03/2015
- Anti-myc stain for w;>STOP>TrpA1-myc;TH-GAL4/Fru-FLP brains / VNCs primary incubated tonight
- Moved over to CLS

01/04/2015

- Anti-myc incubated in donkey anti-mouse AlexaFluor488
- Crz>Chrimson experiments with .0025 Hz stim and 10 s pulses. Haven't put the indicator light back in yet, so you'll have to just deal with that. These guys also don't seem to court that much, and when they do the females seem really unreceptive. Maybe they have gunk / cva on them and that makes them less appealing? Wow, I waited here for hours and not a single one was able to initiate copulation.

01/06/2015

- TH activation of Chrimson kind of stimulated excessive grooming in males wandering around but did not do anything clear.
- TH activation in mating males... couldn't get them to court...

- w;>STOP>TrpA1/+;Fru-FLP/TH-GAL4 at 32* C. Forgot to focus the video, but the copulations I can observe seem normal. Possible the FLP isn't working well

Repeated Crz>Chrimson activation -> heat shock expt. (10 sec Crz activation, 30 sec heat shock, wait 2 min for separation). 0/1 termination

- NP2719>Chrimson using a 12V power supply instead of 19V. 0.005 Hz, 2000 ms. Terminates some but not all copulations. Switched to high power at 12:34 (33 minutes into recording). Marked by finger. This expt. is to confirm Chrimson is still working in these flies.

- Doing the same expt. again, titled "v2."

- Trying with 14V power. Adequate to cause early termination every time, stops copulation on the first flash almost every time.

- Now doing 12 V stimulation (only infrequently caused termination when flashed for 2 s every 200 seconds) but 20 ms every second. Animals court normally. They also seem to copulate normally. I guess it takes a prolonged activation of the GABA neurons to get a phenotype. I'll keep trying expts. with different stimulations though.Actually, copulation is considerably longer than normal. If I supply a long strong pulse, though, it makes them all terminate, so it doesn't
  seem like it's the GABA activity per se, but rather the CHANGE in GABA activity. Will do more expts.

- NP5270>GFP experiments with .005 Hz 2000 ms stim (termination assay) at full power (19.2 V). Obviously, does not cause termination with red light onset.

- NP2719>Chrimson in no light has surprisingly short cop. dur. (mean = 16.33 min), but I only tested 3 flies. I'll keep the camera rolling in case I get more flies. These flies are also pretty old. I think I won't use this data and will try it again next time I do the experiment.

-TH>Chrimson Termination assay (19.2 V, 0.005 Hz, 2000 ms). Yet again pretty hard to get copulation with these flies...

- TH-G'>Chrimson grooming assay. Protocol: 5 minutes no red light, measure fraction of time grooming, then 5 minutes red light, measure fraction of time grooming. LEFT HALF: Chrimson/+ RIGHT HALF: TH-G'>Chrimson all flies are males. Results: hard to say. I'll score the video at some point, but for now it looks like red light promotes grooming in control and TH flies...

- Using the same set-up but with the termination assay looking for cop. dur. phenotypes. TH-G'>Chrimson also doesn't seem to want to court as much as the controls do... wow, the raspi crashed. Never seen that happen before. I wonder what happened. Second video obviously starts a few minutes later. Perhaps the previous experiment depleted a good amount of the dopamine in the TH-G' neurons? Finally got a copulation and the male is acting very spastic, constantly pulling on
  the female. He did eventually stabilize though

- No light controls look good. After I got several copulations, I started playing with various light levels. 11.1 V did nothing with a 2 s stimulation, but with 5 s seems to have slightly more success eliciting a response. Still not a super good at it though.

- Crz>Chrimson heat shock expt. again (15 s in red light, 30 sec at 41*, then wait 2 minutes and see if they broke up). 1/1. Corazonin is easier to activate with 20 Hz, 10 ms stim with the power set to 28.1 V, for future reference.

- Did 1 Hz 20 ms 12 V expt again, cop. dur. looks more like the controls. Guess the high mean before was just by chance. Not broken retinal because I broke up the termination with a prolonged pulse of red light.

- 10 Hz 20 ms 28 V shortens the cop. dur. but the ones on the far right seem less effected for some reason...
